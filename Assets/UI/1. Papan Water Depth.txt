1. Papan Water Depth :

Thalassophobia is an intense and persistent fear of large, deep bodies of water such as oceans or seas. It falls under the category of a specific phobia in psychological terms and often triggers irrational anxiety or panic when an individual is exposed to vast open water, or even images and thoughts of deep, dark underwater spaces.

This fear is not just about water itself, but about the unknown—what lies beneath, the loss of control, and the overwhelming scale of the ocean. People with thalassophobia may experience physical symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, or a racing heart, even without direct danger.


2. Float :

It is a misconception that only people who have nearly drowned can develop thalassophobia. While a traumatic experience like almost drowning can trigger the phobia, it is not the sole cause. Thalassophobia can also develop from indirect exposure, such as 

hearing stories, 
watching disturbing ocean-related media, or
through general anxiety disorders. 

Cognitive predispositions and fear conditioning can also contribute, even without a direct water-related trauma.

3. Camera :

People with thalassophobia often exhibit avoidance behaviors toward environments or media involving the ocean. This can include 

avoiding beaches,
sea travel,
underwater footage, or
even films about marine life. 

Avoidance is a common coping mechanism in specific phobias and can significantly impact quality of life, reinforcing the phobia over time through negative reinforcement.

4. Blood Hand :

Thalassophobia can trigger strong physical symptoms similar to panic or anxiety attacks. These may include

dizziness,
trembling,
sweating, 
nausea, and 
rapid heartbeat, 
even when the threat is only perceived (e.g., seeing an image of deep water). 

These symptoms result from the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, as the brain reacts to the ocean as a perceived danger.


5. Oxygen Mask :

Techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness can help manage acute anxiety symptoms associated with thalassophobia. 

These methods work by downregulating the stress response and promoting parasympathetic nervous system activation, making them useful tools in both therapy and self-regulation.

6. Scuba Mask :

Past traumatic experiences in or near water, such as accidents, witnessing drowning, or extreme fear during swimming, can lead to the development of thalassophobia. 

Trauma affects memory and emotional processing, often resulting in conditioned fear responses that persist long after the event. The association between the trauma and water becomes a lasting psychological trigger.

7. Boat :

In therapy, a common treatment for thalassophobia is exposure therapy, including imaginal exposure—where the patient imagines being in a feared situation, like being on a boat in deep water. 

This method helps reduce fear over time by allowing the brain to reprocess the fear memory in a safe setting, gradually desensitizing the individual to the phobic stimulus.
